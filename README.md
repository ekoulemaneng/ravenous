# Ravenous

Ravenous is a website that allows to fetch data from Yelp API about restaurants in a given location and displays it in a nice way.

## Purpose of the Project  

Our project is to build a restaurant recommendation website that allows users to search for local businesses based on their location and keywords. We will create an application that replicates the core functionality of Yelp, a popular online business directory. 

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Yelp API

## Features

- The website allows users to scroll up and down to navigate through its content.
- Users can simulate a search by typing in the search bar.
- Information is transferred efficiently between components using a unidirectional data flow pattern commonly used in React applications.
- Users can simulate a search query by typing and submitting it in the search bar.
- Users can query for a restaurant based on their location, and sort it by best match, highest rated, and most reviewed.
- Users can view a list of businesses that match their query, sorted by best match, highest rated, or most reviews.
- Users can repeatedly make multiple queries for a restaurant recommendation.

## Future work

1. Create the project and the components.
2. Modularize components by passing information between them.
3. Set the Search Bar's state by managing component state so that the application'components can function together as a team.
4. Interact with the Yelp API to fetch real-world data.
